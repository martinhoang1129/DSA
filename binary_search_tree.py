Binary Search Tree 


PSEUDOCODE: 
1. create node class with value, left and right as constructors 
2. create BST class with root node as constructor. Not applying inheritance in BST class but will be using node class within BST 
3. Make add, find, print functions 
4. add and find function works similarly. Traverse tree starting from root node and use recursion to move. 
    i. if root = NONE > return False (base case) 
    ii. if root = target > return target 

NOTES:

        self.root = None # ?????
